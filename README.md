This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: the null object reference error (TypeError #1009).  The `bug.as` file contains code that attempts to access a property of an object that might be null.  The `bugSolution.as` file shows how to resolve this using null checks or conditional logic.  This is a critical issue to handle in ActionScript development to prevent unexpected crashes and improve application stability.
